1
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,889
Pretty clouds fluffy.

2
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,389
What what?

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,889
I didn't say anything.

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,389
You know a friend of mine actually designed these were

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:29,590
balloons.

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,990
No kidding a balloon,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,490
but for war there's one thing my dad's good at

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,190
its War.

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,390
Yeah,

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,590
it seems to run in the family.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,690
Hey,

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,190
hold on.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,790
Not everyone in my family like that.

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,690
I know.

15
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,190
I know you changed.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,890
I meant my uncle.

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,790
He was more of a father than me.

18
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,090
And I really let him down.

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,990
I think your uncle would be proud of you.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,290
Leaving your home to come help us.

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,290
That's hard.

22
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,390
Wasn't that hard?

23
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,090
Really?

24
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,490
You didn't leave behind any one you cared about?

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,690
Well,

26
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,489
I did have a girlfriend.

27
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,789
May that gloomy girl,

28
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,589
you size a lot.

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,490
Yeah.

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,589
Everyone in the Fire Nation thinks I'm a traitor.

31
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,789
I couldn't drag her into it.

32
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,690
My First Girlfriend turned into the Moon.

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,890
That's rough,

34
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:22,990
buddy.
