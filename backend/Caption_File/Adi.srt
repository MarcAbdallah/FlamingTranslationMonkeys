00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:02,790
Hello there.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,190
My name is audio jack on the vice president of

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,290
education at UT Sciences Toastmasters.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,890
We are a community of students on campus,

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,889
dedicated to improving our public speaking.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,590
And professional skills.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,590
We do this at meetings,

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,790
which we hold every Friday from 6 to 7.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,590
We continue to hold meetings,

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,590
over summer,

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,189
be a zoom and we encourage you to join us.

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,290
Links will be in the description to give you an

13
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,890
idea of what a meeting is like and how we

14
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,890
help our members improve their public speaking.

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,790
We're going to take the next 10 minutes to take

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,090
a one-hour meeting and shrink it down into those 10

17
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,190
minutes.

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,090
I lack of the Toastmaster of the evening which means

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,190
I will conduct the meeting and transition between our speakers.

20
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,590
We're going to have to speaking session.

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,090
The first speaking section is called prepared speeches,

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,090
Sarah,

23
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:57,990
and Spencer,

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,290
have both prepared a speech for us and we'll hear

25
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:00,890
what they have to say.

26
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,190
And our second part of the meeting is called table.

27
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,589
Topics.

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,789
Ming will volunteer himself to come up on stage and

29
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,990
I will give him a question that he's never considered

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,890
before he left to speak on the spot or around

31
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,890
one to two minutes.

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,589
Let's get started.

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,390
First is Sora delivering a speech on what UT science

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,789
is Toastmasters mean to her.

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:40,890
Thank you,

36
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,990
sir for that very inspiring speech.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,690
It's nice to know that even those who look like

38
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,990
they are going to public speaking.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,289
Sometimes have struggles and I think that's something that every

40
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,190
member at your designs is Jump Masters.

41
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,089
Can I test you?

42
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,390
Next up,

43
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,190
we have Spencer Spencer is our vice president of membership

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,390
and he's going to be talking to you about how

45
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,390
Toastmasters helped him transition to UT answer,

46
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,890
take it away.

47
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,990
Austin Spencer again,

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,490
what a great story about how hard it is to

49
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,290
transition to college.

50
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,590
Thank you Spencer for telling us that story.

51
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,690
It's nice to know that everyone deals with transition times

52
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,390
and different way.

53
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,490
Donkey Spencer for such a well,

54
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,790
thought-out speech.

55
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,490
It's nice to know that everyone knows now.

56
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,090
What do we do?

57
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,990
What a nice Beach Spencer.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,790
Thank you.

59
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,290
Answer is one of our most dedicated members.

60
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,190
And again,

61
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,590
just thank you Spencer for sharing your experience.

62
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,590
Now,

63
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,490
I'm going to move on to the second part of

64
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,090
our meeting,

65
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,590
which is the table topics main has volunteered to be

66
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,690
our first tabletopics contestant.

67
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,490
I will ask him a question and then he will

68
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,190
have to respond on the spot.

69
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,090
Here is your question,

70
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,190
meaning.

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,790
You going on a road trip when suddenly your GPS

72
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,990
stops working.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,790
Where were you going and what do you do next?

74
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,590
Very nice man.

75
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,390
Just like Dorothy says,

76
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,090
just keep swimming.

77
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,590
Ming says,

78
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,890
just keep driving.

79
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,990
Would that that is the end of our mini meeting.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,090
